    <a href="http://grubbable.com" class="olive dim"><b>Grubbable</b></a> is a Detroit-based tech company working to grow and support the local food movement by connecting consumers to restaurants that serve locally-sourced food and drinks, and offering them discounts to dine at those restaurants. I came on as a short-term consultant to revamp their visual brand, marketing web presence, and cross-platform mobile app. I produced various print collateral and worked closely with their development teams and contractors to ship their website and mobile apps.

  <i class="db f4 mh0 lh-copy mt0 mb3 silver">Note: the current implementation of their website and mobile app have deviated considerably from my initial implementation.</i>
